r; Gregory, on my word, we'll not carry coals.
g; No, for then we should be colliers.
r; I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
g; Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of the collar.
r; I strike quickly, being moved.
g; But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
r; A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
g; To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou art moved, thou run'st away.
r; A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
g; That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the wall.
r; 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,are ever thrust to the wall:—therefore, I will push Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids to the wall.
g; The quarrel is between our masters, and us their men.
r; 'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the men, I will be civil with the maids; I will cut off their heads.
g; The heads of the maids?
r; Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense thou wilt.

g; They must take it in sense, that feel it.
r; Me they shall feel, while I am able to stand; and 'tis known, I am a pretty piece of flesh.
g; 'Tis well, thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool; here comes two of the house of the Montagues.
r; My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
g; How! turn thy back, and run?
r; Fear me not.
g; No marry: I fear thee!
r; Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
g; I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
r; Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
c; Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
r; I do bite my thumb, sir.
c; Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

r; Is the law of our side, if I say—ay?
g; No.
r; No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.
g; Do you quarrel, sir?
c; Quarrel, sir? no, sir.
r; If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
c; No better.
r; Well, sir.
w; Benvolio, at a distance.
g; Say—better: here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
r; Yes, better, sir.
c; You lie.
r; Draw, if you be men.—Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.[They fight.
y; Part, fools! put up your swords; you know not what you do.[Beats down their Swords.
w; Tybalt.
Tyb. What! art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
y; I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
Or manage it to part these men with me.
Tyb. What! drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word,
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.
Have at thee, coward.[They fight.
w; several persons of both Houses, who join the fray; then w; Citizens, with clubs or partisans.
o; Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
w; Capulet in his gown; and Lady Capulet.
m; What noise is this?—Give me my long sword, ho!
m; A crutch, a crutch!—Why call you for a sword?
m; My sword, I say!—Old Montague is come,And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
